# Lagless Boot (Fabric)

This mod reduces the number of threads used for initialization Minecraft. For computers with lower thread counts (ex. 8 threads) this makes the game not slow down the entire system while it is opening. Alternatively, it may be possible to raise the threads used above Minecraft's default maximum of 8, so setting it to a higher value may improve the game load times on computers with more cores.
